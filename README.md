c-plus-plus-11
==============

This is my C++11 playground.

Some code here are just examples or exercises for C++ features and some code are
really useful and serious.

Most of this code was developed and compiled with GCC on Linux and Cygwin.
For the samples without a Makefile, compile with the command:
``` shell
 g++ -Wall -std=c++11 <INPUT.cpp> -o <OUTPUT>
```

* unified-assignment.cpp - An example for the unified assignment that C++11 enables
as a replacement for the copy-and-swap idiom (See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C++_Idioms/Copy-and-swap).
